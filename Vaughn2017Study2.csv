I was living in the South at that time and flying to New York for lessons.  I felt no connection to my brilliant teacher because she had not prepared me properly, in that she made me enter pieces that were not ready yet, at least in my estimation.  She was a fabulous teacher, but sometimes could not calculate readiness properly (including in her own performing career.)  I was still in high school in Alabama, and would come to Juilliard directly after graduating, but in that senior year, I entered several competitions that my teacher had simply forced things on me that she shouldn't have.  There had already been one obvious disaster in the previous summer at Aspen, Colorado, and she wouldn't realize that it had been wrong choices on her part.  Otherwise, she prepared me mostly well, and after the Dallas competition, in which I did not play the piano particularly well, I did win an award in a New York competition a few months later.  That was the last year I would spend in Alabama, and although I was very fortunate in getting this training (often flying to NYC twice a month), I had little in common by now with my old classmates, who were often jealous of my privilege (although not all were, and some were very close and supportive.)  Still, that limbo sensation between two such extremely polarized cultures was very hard on me, because I was the intermediary between the two.  Nobody from either side communicated with each other except in a very limited way.  My social life during the trips to New York was fun, but the part in my final year in Alabama was very sad, it seems now, and I had a lot of fights with both of my parents.",16.451,172.217,173.522,47,1, ,4,5,3,6,5,5,5,6,4,7,1,4,5,4,4,7,6,5,4.767,36.065,37.382,14,1, ,6,4,6,5,6,4,3.023,77.805,80.403,24,1,64,1, , , , , , ,1, ,usa,english,1,31,6,Pianist,10,2.054,21.627,23.856,3,"I liked doing it, because it made me write about something I'd never quite faced.",2, , ,1.788,6.31,7.341,2,1,1,3,4.5,3.5,6,4.33333333333333,2,1,1,3,7,2,3,4,3,-1.66666666666667,6.697,49.919,51.287,26,1,4,3,5,5,4,6,3,3,4,3.66666666666667,4.33333333333333,5,3,4,5,4
